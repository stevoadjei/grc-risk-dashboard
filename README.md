# üõ°Ô∏è GRC Third-Party Risk Assessment Dashboard

**Live Demo:** https://share.streamlit.io/-/auth/app?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgrcdashboard.streamlit.app%2F

An interactive dashboard for assessing third-party vendor risk, built with Python, Streamlit, and Plotly. This tool provides a data-driven approach to help organizations prioritize threats and avoid costly compliance failures.


## üéØ The Business Problem

Ineffective vendor oversight can lead to data breaches and massive regulatory fines, such as the **$200M+ fines faced by Morgan Stanley**. This dashboard simulates a real-world GRC solution, empowering risk managers to visualize complex data, identify high-risk vendors, and make informed decisions quickly.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive Risk Matrix:** A heatmap visualizing the likelihood and impact of vendor risks.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Users can drill down into the data by risk level, service type, and country.
* **Compliance Tracking:** Monitors vendor compliance against key frameworks like ISO 27001.
* **Specialized AI Risk View:** A dedicated tab assesses AI vendors against emerging threats from the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs.
* **Predictive Scoring:** Each vendor is assigned a "Breach Likelihood Score" based on vulnerabilities and compliance gaps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.8
* **Core Libraries:** Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, NumPy
* **Environment:** venv (Virtual Environment)
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
* **Deployment:** Streamlit Community Cloud
